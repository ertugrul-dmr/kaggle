Introduction

When I started doing this analysis my main goal was getting experience. I'm still learning and trying to improve my skills, so there might be some areas can be improved. My main objectives on this project are:

Explorating and visualising the data with pandas and seaborn packages
Building and tuning couple regression models to get some stable results with sklearn and xgboost packages

Data Set Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993) Attribute Information:

mpg: continuous
cylinders: multi-valued discrete
displacement: continuous
horsepower: continuous
weight: continuous
acceleration: continuous
model year: multi-valued discrete
origin: multi-valued discrete
car name: string (unique for each instance)
